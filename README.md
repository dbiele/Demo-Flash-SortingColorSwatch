# Demo-Flash-SortingColorSwatch
Example sorting interaction created with Adobe Flash CC 2014


#1	Approach#
I created the `XFL` and `AS3` to be flexible, easy to modify and easy to add more features and functionality. The UI is clean and the user experience is basic.

## View Sorting in Action ##
Run the master.swf located in `
FLASH > demonstration_course > final.`
## 1.1	UI ##
Create a clean UI with white space. Shadows were used to show depth. Text prompts the user to do something.
## 1.2	Code ##
### 1.2.1	Make the code as flexible as possible. ###  
Much of this code could be reused for other dragger types.  Itâ€™s a good foundation and could easily be modified.
### 1.2.2	Avoid hard coding values.  ###
I tried to avoid hard coding values.  Ideally, any values dynamic values could be added to an xml file, UI component that could be changed very quickly without changing the code.
### 1.2.3	Use the movieclip symbols for dynamic positioning. ###
Move the symbols on the timeline and the code will use the values when dynamically placing content on the screen.  Publish to see the results.
### 1.2.4	Library Organization ###
I created the folder structure to make it easy to expand and enhance the current library items.  For example, the draggers were designed in include graphics, and custom hit areas.
### 1.2.5	Code Organization ###
I tried to separate the code from the library items. This makes it easy to work on the code without having to jump back to Flash. Trying to be productive. 
# 2	Assumptions #
Essentially, this is a drag and drop without the dragging.  Users would need some prompt to indicate the interactivity.  I also assumed that if built properly, the base AS3 and XFL could be expanded to include additional functionality without having to rebuild the page.
# 3	What would I do or change if I was given more time on the project? #
- Add more colors.
- Allow users to drag color swatch.
- Add question text prompting the user to perform a task using scenarios, etc.
- Use graphics instead of colors
- Place dynamic content in xml or json. Instead of hard coding in AS3. 
- Separate the code more.  Use a MVCX framework like RobotLegs.
- Record user click and interactions.  This could then be saved to the LMS.
- Add visual depth to the graphics.
- One user interaction, have graphics visually indicate they are being clicked.
- Use transform3D to animate clicks.
- Add transitions when content first appears on the screen.
